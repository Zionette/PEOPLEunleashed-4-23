We believe in, we stand for, above all, the God-given freedom of the individual. We hold 
that the Constitution of the United States is the most profoundly important instrument 
ever devised by man for the protection of that freedom – the Constitution as written by 
the Founders of the American Republic, construed in proper context, and safeguarded from 
subversion by a collectivist state.

We support the private enterprise capitalist economic system. The republican form of 
government that protects our freedom cannot otherwise endure. Likewise, without 
Constitutional guarantees, our free enterprise economy cannot long survive. Together, 
they have established the United States of America as the freest and most bountiful nation
on earth.  We perceive as the most serious threat to our freedom and way of life the ideologies of collectivism and state socialism.

We see it as our duty – and as the obligation of all thoughtful, freedom-loving Americans – to oppose 
all efforts for an ever bigger and more omnipotent government that would make the state 
our master rather than the servant of the people as intended by our Founding Fathers.

FIFTY(+) YEARS OF AMERICA’S FUTURE

When America’s Future was founded, over fifty years ago, the Second World War had just 
ended, and the United Nations had just been launched. The Cold War had not yet begun, and 
neither had the conservative movement. Fifty years ago, the number of conservative, constitutionalist, 
free-market-oriented organizations and publications could be counted on one hand. But the number of 
communist-front organizations, to say nothing of liberal and left groups, numbered more 
than one thousand.

Our nation was in transition, and our enemies moved quickly to make the most of it. There 
was an obvious need for organizations and individuals willing to defend the American way. 
And so, on April 24, 1946, America’s Future Inc., a nonprofit, tax-exempt educational 
organization, was founded in New York City by a group of businessmen dedicated to the 
preservation of two great fundamental American principles: the competitive, private 
enterprise system that has made our country strong and prosperous, and the constitutional 
form of government that has kept us free from the tyranny of individuals or factions.

We had among our founding members such distinguished Americans as Frank E. Gannett (our first president), 
Mrs. Amos Pinchot, and Gen. Robert E. Wood of Sears-Roebuck. The many prominent Americans
who have served as trustees include National Association of Manufacturers past president 
Robert L. Lund (a longtime president of America’s Future); Henning W. Prentis Jr. of Armstrong Cork Co.; 
former New Jersey Governor Charles Edison; George W. Strake of Houston; and Charles Hook of Armco Steel.
